# Project Description  
This project is a small game called `Memory Game`. The game will start after loading the application into browser and clicking on Play button. ( `‚ñ∂Ô∏è` )  

- The timer should start counting, immediatly after starting the game and at the same time 8 pairs of pictures should inject into the table's cells randomly.  

- After clicking on each cell the picture of that cell should be displayed and compared with the second selected picture. If they are matched, they should lock as visible, otherwise spin out to their original state after 1 second. (invisible)  

- Finding every pair of pictures, will have 12.5 points for the user. But after 3 consecutive mistakes, the users points should reset to zero.
